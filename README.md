# RETRO CEDULE FONT

*My attempt to recreate font from old Czechoslovak enamel signs.*

Before advent of modern computer-based typesetting these signs were made using font hand crafted templates. In former Czechoslovakia these signs have one very specific font. 

Font designer Ondrej Jób went into this rabbit hole and discovered [how these signs were designed](https://www.setuptype.com/blog/manual) ([he described it in Slovak too](https://www.setuptype.com/sk/blog/manual)). He (re)created family of fonts called [Manual](https://www.setuptype.com/manual) (Grotesk, POZOR, Tatry and Korytnica) which recreates these oldschool fonts for modern typesetting.

I find his project very interesting and I wanted to recreate something similar so this is my attempt to do so.

## TODO

- document my workflow
- commit some letters
- construct some code to convert DXF to SVG_

## licenses

- everything in `glyphs` dir (and all derived font files is under SIL license)
- everything else (especially code but also documentation) is under MIT license
- original fonts enamel signs which I am trying to recreate were designed by anonymous workers based on Richard Pípal work, I have no rights to those
