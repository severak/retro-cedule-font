# RETRO CEDULE FONT

*My attempt to recreate font from old Czechoslovak enamel signs.*

Before advent of modern computer-based typesetting these signs were made using font hand crafted templates. In former Czechoslovakia these signs have one very specific font. 

Font designer Ondrej JÃ³b went into this rabbit hole and discovered [how these signs were designed](https://www.setuptype.com/blog/manual) ([he described it in Slovak too](https://www.setuptype.com/sk/blog/manual)). He (re)created family of fonts called [Manual](https://www.setuptype.com/manual) (Grotesk, POZOR, Tatry and Korytnica) which recreates these oldschool fonts for modern typesetting.

I find his project very interesting and I wanted to recreate something similar so this is my attempt to do so.

## TODO

- document my workflow
- commit some letters
- construct some code to convert DXF to SVG
